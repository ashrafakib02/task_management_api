## 💡 Why This Project Matters

This is **NOT a basic CRUD app**.

It is designed to reflect how real backend systems are built in production:

- Clean architecture (Controller → Service → DB)
- Secure authentication & authorization
- Scalable and maintainable structure
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Production-grade middleware & error handling

---

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected routes with middleware
- Helmet for secure HTTP headers
- Rate limiting for abuse prevention

### 📊 Task Management System
- Full CRUD operations
- Ownership validation (user-specific access)
- RESTful API design

### 🔎 Advanced Querying
- Pagination
- Filtering
- Sorting
- Search functionality

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- Test-ready architecture (Jest)
- ESLint + Prettier for clean code

### 🚀 CI/CD
- GitHub Actions pipeline
- Automated:
  - Lint checks
  - Tests
  - Build validation

### 📄 API Documentation
- Swagger UI for interactive API testing
