## ❗ What Problem This Solves

Most backend tutorials stop at basic CRUD.

This project solves **Real production challenges:**

- 🔐 Secure user authentication & authorization
- 📊 Managing user-specific data (multi-user isolation)
- ⚡ Efficient querying (pagination, filtering, search)
- 🧱 Scalable architecture for growing applications
- 🚀 CI/CD automation for reliable deployments
- 🛡️ Security best practices (rate limit, headers, validation)

👉 Built to reflect how real SaaS backend systems work

---

## ⚡ Features (Quick Scan)

- 🔐 JWT authentication & protected routes
- 🔑 Password hashing (bcrypt)
- 📊 Task CRUD with ownership validation
- 🔎 Pagination, filtering, sorting, search
- 🛡️ Helmet + Rate limiting
- 📄 Swagger API documentation
- 🧪 Test-ready structure (Jest)
- 🚀 CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- 📦 Clean layered architecture
